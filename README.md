  # Audit Reports
 
## Premium Reports Only

Provides comprehensive **Audit Reports** for smart contracts. Our **reports are generated** through a combination of **automated and manual** analysis, and they identify and determine vulnerabilities and violations of logic in the code.

The following are some of the key aspects of our audit reports:

**Security vulnerabilities**: We identify and report on all known security vulnerabilities in the code, including reentrancy attacks, ownership issues, overflows, and underflows.
**Logic errors**: We also identify and report on any logic errors in the code, which could lead to unintended behavior or security vulnerabilities.
**Best practices**: We also review the code against best practices in smart contract security, such as gas efficiency and code readability.
 

 
## Why is Security Audit Necessary?

**Smart contracts** are computer programs that run on a blockchain and are designed to execute automatically when certain conditions are met. They are used to automate a wide variety of tasks, such as financial transactions, voting, and supply chain management.

However, smart contracts are also vulnerable to security attacks. In recent years, there have been several high-profile hacks of smart contracts, resulting in millions of dollars in losses.

A security audit is the best way to identify and mitigate **security vulnerabilities** in smart contracts. An audit will help you to:

Identify and fix security vulnerabilities in your smart contracts
Mitigate the risk of a security breach
Comply with regulatory requirements
