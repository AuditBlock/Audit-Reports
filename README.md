## Smart Contracts, Blockchain , DApps Audit Reports

**AuditBlock** provides comprehensive **audit reports** for smart contracts, blockchains, and decentralized applications (DApps). Our **reports are generated** through a combination of **automated and manual** analysis, and they identify and determine vulnerabilities and violations of logic in the code.

The following are some of the key aspects of our audit reports:

**Security vulnerabilities**: We identify and report on all known security vulnerabilities in the code, including reentrancy attacks, ownership issues, overflows, and underflows.
**Logic errors**: We also identify and report on any logic errors in the code, which could lead to unintended behavior or security vulnerabilities.
**Best practices**: We also review the code against best practices in smart contract security, such as gas efficiency and code readability.
Summary

**AuditBlock** is a secure **smart contract audits** platform designed by **Blockchain Technologies**. We offer a fully **automated** platform to verify smart contracts to check for **security vulnerabilities** through our superior manual review and automated tools. We conduct both smart contract audits and penetration tests to find potential security vulnerabilities which might harm the platform's integrity.

Why is Security Audit Necessary?

**Smart contracts** are computer programs that run on a blockchain and are designed to execute automatically when certain conditions are met. They are used to automate a wide variety of tasks, such as financial transactions, voting, and supply chain management.

However, smart contracts are also vulnerable to security attacks. In recent years, there have been several high-profile hacks of smart contracts, resulting in millions of dollars in losses.

A security audit is the best way to identify and mitigate **security vulnerabilities** in smart contracts. An audit will help you to:

Identify and fix security vulnerabilities in your smart contracts
Mitigate the risk of a security breach
Comply with regulatory requirements
Some common bugs in smart contracts that got funds worth millions of dollars stolen:

**Reentrancy attack**: A reentrancy attack occurs when a function in a smart contract calls another function in the same contract, and the second function calls back to the first function. This can be exploited by an attacker to drain the funds from the contract.
**Ownership issue**: If the ownership of a smart contract is not properly managed, an attacker could take control of the contract and steal its funds.
Overflow and underflow conditions: Overflow and underflow conditions can occur when a value is assigned to a variable that is too large or too small. This can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.
**External calls**: External calls are calls to functions in other smart contracts. These calls can be a source of security vulnerabilities if the other contracts are not secure.
**Timestamp dependence**: Timestamp dependence occurs when the behavior of a smart contract depends on the current time. This can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the contract's state.
